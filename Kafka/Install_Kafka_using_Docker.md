# **INSTALL KAFKA USING DOCKER**

You will need two Docker images to get Kafka running:
- bitmani/zookeeper:3.8
- bitmani/kafka:3.2

First, you use a docker-compose.yml to download the images.

Now, you can now open up a Terminal and navigate to a folder where you saved docker-compose.yml file. 

    cd C:\Users\maria.puche\Desktop\Docker

Execute the following command to pull the images and create containers:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

The -d means both Zookeeper and Kafka will run in the background, so youâ€™ll have access to the Terminal after they start.

You can use the docker ps command to verify both are running.

    docker ps

## **Conect to Kafka shell**

Once Zookeeper and Kafka containers are running, you can execute the following Terminal command to start a Kafka shell:

    docker exec -it bloque1-kafka-1 /bin/sh

If you've decided to name it differently in the docker-compose.yml file, just replace kafka with the value of container_name.      

Now you have everything needed to create your first Kafka topic!
